If you still don't see commands, it's likely because I registered them as **Global Commands**, which can take up to an hour to update.

I will re-run the registration script but specifically for **your server (Guild)**. This makes the update **instant**.

### **What I need from you:**
I need your **Guild ID** (Server ID).

**How to get it:**
1.  Open Discord.
2.  Go to **User Settings** -> **Advanced** -> Turn on **Developer Mode**.
3.  Right-click on your **Server Icon** (on the left sidebar).
4.  Click **"Copy ID"** (or "Copy Server ID").
5.  Paste it here.

Once I have that, I will force-update the commands for your server instantly! 🐰
