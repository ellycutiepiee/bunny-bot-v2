If direct SoundCloud links are still not working, it means the **Lavalink Node** we are using (`lavalink.karing.tech`) might have **SoundCloud disabled** or blocked (this is common for public nodes to save bandwidth).

### **The Fix:**
I will switch to a different Lavalink node that is known to support SoundCloud.

**New Node Candidate:** `lavalink.devamop.in` (A popular, reliable public node).

**Plan:**
1.  **Update `.env`:** Change `LAVALINK_URL` and `LAVALINK_AUTH` to the new node.
2.  **Restart Bot:** Apply changes.

I'll switch the node now! 🐰
