Aha! This explains everything.

Your tunnel `bunnybot` is a **Locally Managed Tunnel** (Legacy). This means it was created via command line and relies on a local `config.yml` file, which is why you don't see the "Install Service" command in the dashboard.

### **The Solution: Migrate to Dashboard**
You should click **Start Migration**.
*   This converts it into a "Modern" tunnel that you can manage fully from the website.
*   **It is safe.** It won't break your site.

**Steps:**
1.  Click **Start Migration**.
2.  It will ask you to confirm. Click **Confirm** (or Next).
3.  Once migrated, the dashboard will change.
4.  You will then see a **"Configure"** or **"Overview"** tab.
5.  Look for **"Install and run a connector"**.
6.  Copy the **Windows** command (the one with the token `ey...`).
7.  Paste it here!

Go ahead and click that migration button! 🐰🚀
