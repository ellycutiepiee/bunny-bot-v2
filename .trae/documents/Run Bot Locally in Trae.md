Got it! You want to run the bot **locally here in Trae** instead of dealing with Render deployment.

Since I already verified it works perfectly locally in the last step, I just need to:

1.  **Start the server again:** Run the `npm run dev` command to bring the bot and website online on your local machine.
2.  **Provide the Local URL:** You can then access the website at `http://localhost:3000` and use the bot in Discord immediately.

No further code changes are needed since it's already working locally! I'll just start it up for you.
