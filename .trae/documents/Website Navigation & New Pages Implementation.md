I can definitely help you polish the website functionality! 🐰✨

Here is the plan to fix your buttons and pages:

### **1. Fix "Features" Button**
*   **Goal:** Make it smooth scroll down to the "Why Bunny?" section.
*   **Action:** I will add an `id="features"` to the "Why Bunny?" section and update the button link to `#features`.

### **2. Create "Premium" Page**
*   **Goal:** A cool "Coming Soon" page with a golden theme.
*   **Action:**
    *   Create a new page at `/premium`.
    *   Design it with a gold/dark gradient background.
    *   Add a "Coming Soon" message and maybe a golden bunny icon.

### **3. Create "Commands" Page**
*   **Goal:** A cool list of all bot commands.
*   **Action:**
    *   Create a new page at `/commands`.
    *   List categories like **Music**, **Moderation**, **Fun**.
    *   Make it searchable (if possible) or just a nice grid layout.

### **4. Update Navigation Bar**
*   **Goal:** Connect all these new pages to the buttons in the header.
*   **Action:** Update `components/Header.tsx` (or similar) to point to the new routes.

I will start by creating the new pages and linking them up! 🚀
