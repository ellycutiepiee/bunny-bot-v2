I have restarted the tunnel! 🐰

### **1. Fix for "503 - Tunnel Unavailable"**
The tunnel stopped running. I have restarted it.
**Please try `https://bunnybot.loca.lt` again now.**
(It might ask for the password `37.97.7.243` again).

**Important:** For this to keep working, **do not close the terminal** running the tunnel command (Terminal 9). If that closes, the site goes offline.

### **2. About "One-Time Purchase" Domains**
**Short Answer:** **No, standard domains are never one-time purchases.**

*   **How it works:** Domains like `.com`, `.org`, `.net` are **rented** (like an apartment). You must pay a renewal fee every year (usually $10-$20/year) to keep them. If you stop paying, you lose the name.
*   **"Blockchain" Domains:** There are "one-time purchase" domains like `.crypto` or `.eth` (Unstoppable Domains), **BUT** normal web browsers (Chrome/Edge) **cannot open them** without special plugins. They will **not work** for a Discord bot redirect or a public website for normal users.

**Recommendation:**
If you want a professional name, the cheapest reliable option is buying a `.com` or `.org` from a registrar like **Namecheap** or **Cloudflare** for about **$10/year**.

For now, the **free** `bunnybot.loca.lt` is your best option if you don't want to pay a yearly fee!
