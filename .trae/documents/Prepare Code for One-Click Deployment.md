Since I cannot log in to your accounts directly (I am an AI running on your computer), I will do the next best thing: I will **automate the code preparation** so all you have to do is "drag and drop" or "click connect".

Here is the plan to make this as automatic as possible for you:

1. **Commit Your Code**: I will use your local git to save all the changes we've made (Docker, Stripe, Premium features) so they are ready to upload.
2. **Verify GitHub Connection**: I will check if your project is linked to GitHub.

   * *If yes*: I will push the code for you.

   * *If no*: I will ask for your repository URL to link it.
3. **Provide a "Copy-Paste" Cheat Sheet**: I will generate a single block of text with all your Environment Variables (Tokens, Secrets) so you can just copy it once into Railway/Render.

**Once I finish this step:**

* You will only need to go to **Railway.app** (or Render), login with GitHub, and select this repository.

* The `Dockerfile` I created will handle the rest automatically.
