It's okay! Cloudflare's UI can be confusing. Since you are in the **Overview** tab after migrating:

1.  Look for a section called **"Install and run a connector"** (it might be at the bottom or you might need to scroll).
2.  If you don't see it, look for a tab or button that says **"Connectors"** (next to Overview? or inside it?).
3.  Click on the **"Windows"** icon (it looks like a window logo).

**If you STILL can't find the command:**
Don't worry. We can do it the "Hacker Way" which is actually easier because you don't need to find anything in the UI.

**Alternative Plan (The "Easy" Way):**
1.  I will log you in via the terminal.
2.  I will run `cloudflared login`.
3.  It will give you a link. You click it.
4.  You select your domain.
5.  I will create a *new* tunnel automatically for you.

**Do you want to keep looking for the command in the dashboard, or should we just do the "Easy Terminal Login" method?** (I recommend the terminal method if you are stuck!) 🐰
