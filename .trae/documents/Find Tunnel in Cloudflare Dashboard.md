Ah, Cloudflare updated their UI slightly!

Click on **Connectors**.

Inside **Connectors**, you should see:
1.  **Cloudflare Tunnel** (or just "Tunnels").
2.  Or a list of tunnels directly.

If you don't see Tunnels under Connectors, try **Routes** -> **Tunnels** (sometimes they move it there).

**Wait, actually:**
If you see **Networks**, look for **Tunnels** *inside* that menu (it might be a sub-item of Tunnels or Connectors).

**Let's try this shortcut:**
If you can't find it, we can create a **NEW** tunnel command from scratch right here, but you would need to log in via the terminal.

**Easier Path:**
1.  Go to **Connectors**.
2.  Do you see a tunnel listed there? (Maybe named `bunnybot`?).
3.  If yes, click it.

If you are totally lost in the UI (Cloudflare changes it often), just tell me "I can't find it" and I will guide you to **create a new tunnel from the terminal** instead, which might be easier! 🐰
