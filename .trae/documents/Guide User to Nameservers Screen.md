Okay, I understand exactly where you are! You are in the **DNS** section of Cloudflare, which is great.

You are seeing "No DNS records" because you haven't finished the setup yet.

### **Here is what to do next (Very Simple):**

1.  **Ignore the DNS records part for now.** You don't need to add anything there yet.
2.  Look for a button at the bottom right or top right that says **"Continue"** or **"Next"**.
    *   (If you don't see it, look for a blue banner or scroll all the way down).
3.  The **NEXT screen** is the important one. It will say:
    *   **"Determine your registrar"** (It will say GoDaddy).
    *   **"Log in to your GoDaddy account..."**
    *   **"Replace with Cloudflare's nameservers"**.

**Action:**
Click **Continue** (or Next) on that DNS page until you see the screen with **two Nameservers** (they look like `something.ns.cloudflare.com`).

**Once you see those two names, copy them and tell me "I got the names!"** (Or paste them here). Then we go to GoDaddy.
