I tried to do it, but **I cannot log in to your Cloudflare account for you** because I don't have your password! 🔒

You **must** do this step yourself.

### **Action Required:**
1.  **Click this link:** (It should have opened in your browser, but if not, copy/paste this):
    `https://dash.cloudflare.com/argotunnel?aud=&callback=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.cloudflareaccess.org%2Fmu69YI1uZHUAyKzkzh-r6YYxylt0MXstORuEUPWKBQk%3D`
2.  **Log in** to your Cloudflare account.
3.  Select your domain `bunny-bot.com` if asked.
4.  Click **Authorize**.

**Once you see a "Success" message in your browser, come back here and type "Done".**

Then I can do the rest (creating the tunnel and connecting it)! 🐰
