Okay, you want `bunnybot` as the main name, followed by *any* free extension.

Since `bunnybot.com` / `.org` / `.net` cost money, here are the best **FREE** options where you can likely get `bunnybot`:

1.  **`bunnybot.loca.lt`** (Using Localtunnel - we can try to reserve this right now).
2.  **`bunnybot.serveo.net`** (Using Serveo - very easy, no install needed).
3.  **`bunnybot.tailscale.fun`** (Using Tailscale Funnel - requires account).

I will try **Localtunnel** first because we already installed it. If `bunnybot.loca.lt` is taken, we can try `bunnybot-v2.loca.lt` or similar.

**Revised Plan:**
1.  **Try to reserve `bunnybot`:** I will run a command to see if `https://bunnybot.loca.lt` is available.
2.  **Update Script:** If it works, I'll update your start script to use this permanent, nice-looking URL.
3.  **You Update Discord:** You will put this new URL into the Discord Developer Portal.

Let's try to get you `bunnybot.loca.lt`!
